# Launch

This folder contains two subfolders, one for python scripts, the other for bash scripts. 

For each type, the model_run script runs the model to calculate the impacts, while the test_sensitivity allows to test
the role of the different uncertainties in the model (the only possible flexible arguments are the region, the time and the scenario). 

The bash script launches climada and allows to run the model from the terminal with different inputs, 
while the python script translate these inputs in python.
